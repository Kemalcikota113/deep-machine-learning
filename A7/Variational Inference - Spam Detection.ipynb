    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment to go beyond a traditional classifier and apply variational methods.\n",
    "This means that we will train a model using some parameters over the distribution of which we have a prior belief.\n",
    "Our prior belief here is actually that each and every parameter independently follows a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During optimization, we will draw sets of parameters from our variational distribution $q_{\\phi}$.\n",
    "Drawing these parameters needs to be done using the reparameterization trick, so that we can add noise, i.e., $w_i=\\mu_i+\\sigma_i\\cdot\\epsilon$.\n",
    "The assignment also poses one or the other question (clearly marked), you need to provide your answer directly after.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment has some blank spots for you to fill out (but you can customize your implementation to your liking).\n",
    "Training should be done using stochastic gradient descend, either using manual gradient updates or using an optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use autodiff-capabilities to compute gradients.\n",
    "It is recommended to use, for example, JAX or PyTorch.\n",
    "We recommend the latter, using it in a functional way (i.e., using `torch.func.jacrev`).\n",
    "The blanks left in this assignment and their type hints assume PyTorch.\n",
    "There are some cells with quick tests/sanity-checks, that you are free to remove, especially if they do not go along with how you chose to implement your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the assignment, after training, you need to pick one advanced method of evaluation.\n",
    "We are not interested in traditional metrics here (e.g., accuracy, Kappa, F1, etc.; although you are welcome to show those).\n",
    "Rather, we want to exploit the variational nature of the model here and show something more interesting."

    "- **Motivation:** Why you selected this particular evaluation.\n",
    "- **Implementation:** How exactly your approach was implemented (with brief explanations for your visualization and choice of metrics).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Visualization of Learned Low-dimensional Representations**\n",
    "    * Visualize embeddings from your variational polynomial model using dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, t-SNE, UMAP).\n",
    "    * Color embeddings by posterior uncertainty estimates or predictions.\n",
    "    * This illustrates nicely how your model's uncertainty varies across regions of your feature space.\n",
    "2. **Posterior Predictive Checks (PPC) (Visualizations of uncertainty)**\n",
    "    * Posterior predictive checks evaluate your model by extending its sampled posterior parameters forward into the data space, then comparing the simulated data (from the posterior) with the real observed data.\n",
    "3. **Evaluation of the ELBO on Hold-out Data and Bayesian (Probabilistic) Performance Metrics**\n",
    "    * Evaluate the quality of your approximate posterior by evaluating ELBO on the hold-out set.\n",
    "    * Bayesian performance metrics, for example: Log Predictive Density (LPD) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)\n",

    "5. **Out-of-Distribution (OoD) Detection Capability incl. Likelihood-Based Evaluation (Density Estimation Quality)**\n",
    "    * E.g., generate data points far away from the hold-out dataset and evaluate likelihood, uncertainty, etc.\n",
    "    * Compare computed likelihood of the train- and hold-out dataset.\n",
    "6. **Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Calibration Curves (Reliability Diagrams)**\n",
    "    * Expected Calibration Error numerically summarizes the calibration curves, giving you a single statistic to quantify how good or poor calibration of a model is.\n",
    "7. **Latent Space Smoothness and Structure**\n",
    "    * Generate intermediate points (linear interpolation) between latent variables from spam and non-spam messages and decode these embeddings. Good generative models produce semantically smooth interpolations.\n",
    "8. **Qualitative Evaluation of a few messages**\n",
    "    * Pick about ~10 messages from the holdout dataset. Among those 10, you should have some that are obviously spam, some that are ambiguous, and some that are clearly ham.\n",
    "    * Evaluate the model's predictions and uncertainty about these predictions. Is there a scheme that materializes here?"
