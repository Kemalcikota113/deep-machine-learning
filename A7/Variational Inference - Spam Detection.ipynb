    "In this assignment, we will load the UCI SMS Spam Collection dataset.\n",

    "## Setting the Scene\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this assignment to go beyond a traditional classifier and apply variational methods.\n",
    "This means that we will train a model using some parameters over the distribution of which we have a prior belief.\n",
    "Our prior belief here is actually that each and every parameter independently follows a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "During optimization, we will draw sets of parameters from our variational distribution $q_{\\phi}$.\n",
    "Drawing these parameters needs to be done using the reparameterization trick, so that we can add noise, i.e., $w_i=\\mu_i+\\sigma_i\\cdot\\epsilon$.\n",
    "The assignment also poses one or the other question (clearly marked), you need to provide your answer directly after.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment has some blank spots for you to fill out (but you can customize your implementation to your liking).\n",
    "Training should be done using stochastic gradient descend, either using manual gradient updates or using an optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use autodiff-capabilities to compute gradients.\n",
    "It is recommended to use, for example, JAX or PyTorch.\n",
    "We recommend the latter, using it in a functional way (i.e., using `torch.func.jacrev`).\n",
    "The blanks left in this assignment and their type hints assume PyTorch.\n",
    "There are some cells with quick tests/sanity-checks, that you are free to remove, especially if they do not go along with how you chose to implement your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of the assignment, after training, you need to pick one advanced method of evaluation.\n",
    "We are not interested in traditional metrics here (e.g., accuracy, Kappa, F1, etc.; although you are welcome to show those).\n",
    "Rather, we want to exploit the variational nature of the model here and show something more interesting."

This is becuase i already learned a mean $\\mu$ and standard deviation ´$\\sigma$ for all of my weights. So visualizing those as a bar plot with error bars would be pretty easy to code with a simple matplotlib figure.\n"
